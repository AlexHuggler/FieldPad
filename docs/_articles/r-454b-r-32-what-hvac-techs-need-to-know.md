summary: "R-454B (GWP 466) and R-32 (GWP 675) are A2L-classified refrigerants replacing R-410A (GWP 2088) in new HVAC equipment as part of the AIM Act's HFC phasedown. Unlike R-410A, these refrigerants are mildly flammable and require modified handling procedures, A2L-rated recovery equipment, and specific safety protocols during service. R-454B is a zeotropic blend of R-32 and R-1234yf, while R-32 is a single-component refrigerant. Both operate at similar pressures to R-410A but require technicians to complete A2L safety checklists and use spark-free tools during service."

New residential and commercial HVAC equipment is shipping with **R-454B** and **R-32** as the primary replacements for R-410A. For field technicians, this means encountering these refrigerants with increasing frequency on service calls, warranty work, and new installations. Understanding how they behave, how they differ from R-410A, and what they require from you in the field is essential knowledge.

## The Refrigerant Transition at a Glance

The **American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act** mandates an 85% phasedown of HFC production and consumption by 2036. R-410A, with a **GWP of 2088**, is a primary target. Manufacturers have converged on two replacements:

- **R-454B** (Opteon XL41 by Chemours) with a GWP of 466
- **R-32** with a GWP of 675

Both carry the **A2L safety classification** under ASHRAE Standard 34, meaning they are mildly flammable.

## Properties Comparison: R-410A vs. R-454B vs. R-32

| Property | R-410A | R-454B | R-32 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GWP (AR5)** | 2088 | 466 | 675 |
| **ASHRAE Safety Class** | A1 (non-flammable) | A2L (mildly flammable) | A2L (mildly flammable) |
| **Composition** | R-32/R-125 (50/50) | R-32/R-1234yf (68.9/31.1) | Single component |
| **Type** | Near-azeotropic | Zeotropic blend | Pure compound |
| **Temperature Glide** | ~0.1degC | ~1.5degC | None |
| **Boiling Point (1 atm)** | -51.4degC | -50.9degC | -51.7degC |
| **Operating Pressures** | Baseline | Similar to R-410A | Slightly higher |
| **LFL** | N/A | ~307 g/m3 | ~306 g/m3 |
| **Burning Velocity** | N/A | ~2.4 cm/s | ~6.7 cm/s |

## R-454B: What You Need to Know

R-454B is a **zeotropic blend** of R-32 (68.9%) and R-1234yf (31.1%), producing a **temperature glide** of approximately 1.5degC.

**Charging**: Because R-454B is zeotropic, it must always be **charged as a liquid**. Vapor charging alters the blend ratio and degrades performance.

**Recovery**: Recovered R-454B may have shifted composition. Send it to an **EPA-certified reclaimer** rather than reusing it directly in a different system.

**Compatibility**: R-454B is **not a drop-in replacement** for R-410A. It is designed for new equipment engineered for its properties. Do not retrofit existing R-410A systems with R-454B.

## R-32: What You Need to Know

R-32 is a **single-component refrigerant** with no temperature glide, no composition shift during recovery, and no blend fractionation concerns.

**Higher Discharge Temperatures**: R-32 produces **higher compressor discharge temperatures** than R-410A. Equipment designed for R-32 includes enhanced cooling features. Always reference manufacturer specifications rather than applying R-410A benchmarks.

**Higher Burning Velocity**: R-32 has a burning velocity of ~6.7 cm/s compared to R-454B's ~2.4 cm/s. While both are below the 10 cm/s A2L threshold, R-32's faster flame propagation reinforces the importance of ventilation and spark-free tool verification.

**Charge Size Limitations**: Some building codes impose **lower maximum charge sizes** for R-32 in occupied spaces. Adding refrigerant beyond the nameplate charge could push an installation out of code compliance.

## Handling Differences from R-410A

The most significant shift is in **safety handling requirements**:

### Recovery Equipment

Your existing R-410A recovery machine is almost certainly **not rated for A2L refrigerants**. A2L-rated recovery equipment uses intrinsically safe electrical components that cannot serve as ignition sources. Budget for A2L-rated equipment as a necessary investment.

### Leak Detection

Standard heated-diode leak detectors may use sensor elements that can ignite flammable vapors. **A2L-rated leak detectors** use intrinsically safe sensing technology and are calibrated for A2L compounds.

### Brazing

Before applying any open flame to an A2L system, the system must be **fully evacuated of refrigerant** and verified with a vacuum gauge. Confirm with your leak detector that no residual refrigerant is present.

### Labeling and Identification

R-454B cylinders use an **orange body color**, while R-32 cylinders are typically **orchid (light purple)**. Familiarize yourself with these color codes to quickly identify the refrigerant type before beginning service.

## Field Service Considerations for Solo Technicians

Solo technicians face unique challenges with A2L refrigerants. Without a second person on site, you are responsible for your own safety monitoring, emergency response, and compliance documentation.

**Before starting work**, complete the full A2L safety checklist. Verify ventilation, confirm your tools are rated, and ensure your PPE is appropriate. Let someone know where you are working.

**During service**, maintain continuous awareness. If you notice the smell of refrigerant, stop work and ventilate before continuing. Keep your leak detector accessible throughout the service event.

**After service**, document everything. Record the refrigerant type, quantities added or recovered, safety checklist completion, and any anomalies observed.

## Compliance Documentation with FieldPad

FieldPad automatically detects the **regulatory framework** for each service event based on refrigerant type and GWP. When you log service on an A2L system, FieldPad applies **AIM Act Subpart C** compliance requirements, including the A2L safety checklist, appropriate leak rate thresholds (10% for comfort cooling, 20% for commercial, 30% for industrial), and charge size thresholds (15 lbs for systems with GWP above 53).

All compliance data is attached to the equipment profile, creating a complete service history. When a manufacturer or inspector asks for documentation, you can produce a full record directly from the app.

## Key Takeaways

- **R-454B and R-32 are the primary R-410A replacements**, driven by the AIM Act's HFC phasedown.
- **Both are A2L (mildly flammable)**, requiring safety procedures and equipment that differ from non-flammable R-410A.
- **R-454B is a zeotropic blend** that must be liquid-charged. R-32 is a pure compound with no glide or fractionation concerns.
- **Your existing R-410A recovery equipment and leak detectors may not be rated for A2L refrigerants.** Verify ratings before use.
- **Neither is a drop-in replacement** for R-410A. They are designed for new, purpose-built equipment.
- **FieldPad automates compliance documentation** by integrating safety checklists and regulatory framework detection into your service workflow.
