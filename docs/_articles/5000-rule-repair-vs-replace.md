summary: "The 5,000 Rule is an EPA guideline that helps HVAC technicians decide whether to repair or replace leaking refrigeration equipment. The calculation multiplies the cost of refrigerant per pound by the equipment's full charge in pounds. If the result exceeds $5,000, replacement may be more economical than continued repair. While not a regulatory mandate, the 5,000 Rule is a widely used industry benchmark that helps solo technicians make defensible repair-vs-replace recommendations to clients. FieldPad includes a built-in 5,000 Rule calculator that provides instant recommendations."

## What Is the 5,000 Rule?

The **5,000 Rule** is an industry guideline used by HVAC and refrigeration technicians to evaluate whether continued repair of leaking equipment is economically justified or whether replacement makes more sense. If the cost of a full refrigerant charge exceeds $5,000, the economics increasingly favor replacement over repeated repair.

The 5,000 Rule is **not an EPA regulation**. The EPA does not mandate equipment replacement based on refrigerant cost. However, the rule has become a widely recognized **industry benchmark** because it provides an objective, defensible basis for repair-vs-replace recommendations -- especially valuable for solo technicians presenting options to clients.

## The Formula

**Refrigerant Cost per Pound x Full Charge (lbs) = Total Charge Cost**

If the **Total Charge Cost exceeds $5,000**, replacement should be seriously considered. The logic is straightforward: if it costs more than $5,000 just to fill a system with refrigerant -- not counting labor, leak detection, or parts -- the ongoing cost of maintaining that system is likely unsustainable.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: R-22 Commercial Condensing Unit

An R-22 condensing unit serving a walk-in cooler has a full charge of **28 pounds**. Reclaimed R-22 costs approximately **$85 per pound**.

**$85 x 28 lbs = $2,380**

**Below $5,000.** The rule does not flag this system for replacement. However, R-22 prices continue rising year over year, so the customer should plan for eventual replacement.

### Example 2: R-22 Supermarket Rack System

An R-22 rack system with a full charge of **125 pounds** at **$85 per pound**:

**$85 x 125 lbs = $10,625**

**Well above $5,000.** Replacement or retrofit is strongly indicated. At $10,625 for refrigerant alone, each major leak event carries enormous cost.

### Example 3: R-410A Rooftop Unit

A commercial R-410A rooftop unit with a full charge of **22 pounds** at **$25 per pound**:

**$25 x 22 lbs = $550**

**Far below $5,000.** This system is not a replacement candidate based on refrigerant economics. Repair is the clear recommendation.

### Example 4: R-404A Industrial Freezer

A large R-404A freezer system with a full charge of **180 pounds** at **$35 per pound**:

**$35 x 180 lbs = $6,300**

**Exceeds $5,000.** Combined with R-404A's very high GWP (3,922) and increasing regulatory pressure under the [AIM Act](https://www.epa.gov/climate-hfcs-reduction) phasedown, there is both an economic and regulatory case for replacement.

## When the 5,000 Rule Is Most Useful

- **Recurring leak repairs**: Systems requiring multiple refrigerant additions over 12 to 24 months are prime candidates for analysis. If the system already exceeds EPA leak rate thresholds and a full recharge costs near $5,000, replacement becomes compelling.

- **End-of-life equipment**: Systems nearing the end of their 15 to 20 year expected service life. When a system is both old and expensive to recharge, the 5,000 Rule quantifies the financial case.

- **Phased-out or phasing-down refrigerants**: R-22 is fully phased out. R-404A and other high-GWP HFCs face AIM Act production caps. As supply tightens and prices rise, more systems will cross the $5,000 threshold.

- **Capital planning conversations**: Solo technicians often serve as the primary advisor for small business owners who rely on refrigeration. The 5,000 Rule anchors the conversation with a concrete number.

### When It Does Not Apply

- Systems using inexpensive, widely available refrigerant (R-410A at current prices).
- One-time leaks caused by physical damage where a single repair restores years of service.
- Systems under warranty or service agreements that absorb refrigerant costs.
- Situations where replacement is not feasible in the short term due to lead times or operational requirements.

## Communicating Results to Clients

The 5,000 Rule's greatest strength is its simplicity. Clients who do not understand leak rates or EPA thresholds can immediately grasp a dollar figure.

**Below $5,000:** "Your system holds 22 pounds of R-410A. A full charge costs about $550. Repairing the leak is economically sound."

**Above $5,000:** "Your system holds 125 pounds of R-22. A full charge costs over $10,000. R-22 is no longer manufactured, so this price will only increase. I recommend we start planning for replacement."

**Near $5,000:** "Your refrigerant cost is around $4,800 for a full charge. If this system leaks again within the next year, repair costs will likely exceed a down payment on new equipment. I suggest we repair now but budget for replacement within 12 to 18 months."

This approach positions you as a trusted advisor rather than someone pushing unnecessary equipment sales.

## Factors Beyond the 5,000 Rule

A complete repair-vs-replace analysis should also consider:

- **Equipment age and remaining useful life**: A 5-year-old system with a repairable leak differs from a 20-year-old system with the same issue.
- **Energy efficiency gains**: Modern equipment may pay for itself through reduced energy costs.
- **Regulatory trajectory**: Refrigerants facing AIM Act phasedowns will become more expensive. A system below $5,000 today may cross the threshold within 2 to 3 years.
- **Parts availability**: Older equipment may use discontinued components.

## How FieldPad's Built-In Calculator Works

FieldPad includes a **5,000 Rule calculator** accessible directly from the app:

1. **Select the refrigerant type**. FieldPad maintains current refrigerant pricing, or you can enter a custom price.
2. **Enter the full charge**. If the equipment is already in FieldPad, the charge is pulled automatically from the equipment profile.
3. **View the result**. FieldPad calculates the total charge cost and compares it against the $5,000 threshold with a clear recommendation.
4. **Include in reports**. The calculation can be added to service reports and estimates, providing documented justification for your recommendation.

The calculator provides a professional, documented output that strengthens your credibility with clients and protects you if a recommendation is ever questioned.

## Key Takeaways

- **The 5,000 Rule multiplies refrigerant cost per pound by the system's full charge** to evaluate whether replacement should be considered.
- **It is an industry guideline, not an EPA regulation**, but provides a defensible basis for repair-vs-replace recommendations.
- **R-22 and high-GWP HFC systems** are most likely to exceed the threshold due to rising costs and shrinking supply.
- **R-410A and newer refrigerants** at current prices rarely trigger the rule for typical systems.
- **The rule is most valuable for client communication**, translating complex factors into a single, understandable number.
- **Consider factors beyond refrigerant cost**, including equipment age, energy efficiency, and regulatory trajectory.
- **FieldPad's built-in calculator** automates the calculation, pulls equipment data from existing profiles, and generates documentation for client reports.
