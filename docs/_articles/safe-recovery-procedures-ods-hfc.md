summary: "Refrigerant recovery is a core competency for EPA Section 608-certified technicians. Safe recovery requires proper equipment rated for the specific refrigerant type, clean and appropriately labeled recovery cylinders, and careful procedures to prevent cross-contamination. For ODS refrigerants, recovery to EPA-mandated vacuum levels is required before opening systems. For HFC refrigerants under Subpart C, similar requirements apply to systems with 15+ lbs of charge and GWP above 53. This guide covers the recovery process from preparation through documentation."

Refrigerant recovery is one of the most fundamental procedures in HVAC service work, and it is one of the most regulated. Since the Clean Air Act amendments established the **Section 608** venting prohibition, every technician has been required to recover refrigerant before opening a system for service or disposal. The AIM Act's **Subpart C** extends similar requirements to HFC refrigerants. Getting recovery right means doing it safely, doing it completely, and documenting it properly.

This guide walks through the complete recovery process for ODS and HFC refrigerants, from pre-recovery assessment through final documentation.

## Before You Start: Pre-Recovery Assessment

Every recovery operation begins with assessment, not with connecting hoses. Taking five minutes to evaluate the situation prevents contamination mistakes, equipment damage, and safety incidents.

### Identify the Refrigerant

Never assume you know what refrigerant is in a system. **Verify the refrigerant type** using the equipment nameplate, service records, or a refrigerant identifier. Mixed or unknown refrigerants require special handling and must be recovered into dedicated contaminated refrigerant cylinders. Recovering an unknown refrigerant into a cylinder containing a different type contaminates both charges and creates a disposal problem.

Common identification methods include:

- **Equipment nameplate**: Lists the design refrigerant charge type and weight
- **Previous service records**: May indicate if the system was retrofitted to a different refrigerant
- **Refrigerant identifier**: A handheld instrument that samples vapor from the system and identifies the refrigerant composition. Essential for older systems or any system without clear documentation

### Assess System Condition

Before connecting your recovery machine, evaluate the system for conditions that could complicate recovery:

- **Known leaks**: If the system has a significant leak, much of the charge may already be lost. Estimate the remaining charge based on operating pressures compared to the expected saturation pressure for the ambient temperature.
- **Compressor burnout**: Systems with burned compressors may contain acid contamination. Recovering acid-contaminated refrigerant requires awareness that the recovered material will need reclamation or destruction rather than reuse. Use a separate recovery cylinder to avoid contaminating your clean recovered refrigerant inventory.
- **System pressure**: Note the standing pressure before beginning recovery. A system at atmospheric pressure or below likely has little to no refrigerant remaining.
- **Oil logging**: Systems that have been off for extended periods may have significant refrigerant dissolved in the compressor oil. This refrigerant will come out of solution slowly during recovery, extending the time needed to reach the required vacuum level.

### Select the Right Recovery Cylinder

Recovery cylinders must be:

- **DOT-rated** for the pressures involved (DOT 4BA or 4BW for most HVAC refrigerants)
- **Properly labeled** with the refrigerant type and "RECOVERY" markings
- **Within hydrostatic test date** (retest required every 5 years, stamped on the cylinder)
- **Not overfilled** from previous recovery operations. Check the tare weight and current weight before connecting. Never exceed **80% of the cylinder's water capacity** by weight.

Using the wrong cylinder or an expired cylinder is both a safety hazard (cylinder failure under pressure) and a regulatory violation.

## Required Vacuum Levels

EPA Section 608 mandates specific vacuum levels that must be reached during recovery before a system can be opened. These levels vary by the equipment type and the refrigerant charge size:

### Equipment with More Than 200 lbs of Charge

| Recovery Equipment Date | Required Vacuum (inches Hg) |
|---|---|
| Manufactured before Nov 15, 1993 | 0 psig |
| Manufactured after Nov 15, 1993 | 0 inches Hg (full vacuum) |

### Equipment with Less Than 200 lbs of Charge

| Recovery Equipment Date | Required Vacuum (inches Hg) |
|---|---|
| Manufactured before Nov 15, 1993 | 0 psig (for systems above 200 lbs), 4 inches Hg vacuum (below 200 lbs) |
| Manufactured after Nov 15, 1993 | 10 inches Hg vacuum (most common scenario) |

For **very small appliances** (containing less than 5 lbs of charge), the requirement is to recover 90% of the charge or achieve 4 inches Hg vacuum when the recovery device is manufactured after November 15, 1993.

In practice, most field recovery operations on commercial and residential equipment target **10 inches Hg vacuum** using modern recovery equipment.

## Step-by-Step Recovery Process

### Step 1: Connect Equipment and Verify

Connect your recovery machine to the system's service ports using clean, undamaged hoses. Connect the recovery machine outlet to the recovery cylinder. Before starting the machine, verify all connections are secure and all valves are in the correct starting position.

**Purge your hoses** before connecting to prevent introducing air or moisture into the system. Most manifold gauges and recovery machines have purge capabilities. The few seconds this takes prevents contamination of the recovered refrigerant.

### Step 2: Liquid Recovery Phase

Begin by recovering **liquid refrigerant** first. This is the most efficient phase of recovery, as liquid contains far more refrigerant by volume than vapor. Connect to the liquid service valve (if available) or the system's high side. Open the recovery machine inlet valve and start the unit.

Monitor the recovery cylinder weight continuously. **Never leave a recovery operation unattended.** Cylinder overfill is a serious safety hazard. If the cylinder approaches 80% capacity, stop recovery and switch to a fresh cylinder.

During liquid recovery, watch the sight glass on your recovery machine (if equipped). When liquid flow stops and you see vapor or foam in the sight glass, the liquid recovery phase is complete.

### Step 3: Vapor Recovery Phase

After liquid recovery is complete, switch to **vapor recovery** by connecting to the low side or vapor service port. The recovery machine will now pull remaining vapor from the system. This phase takes longer per pound of refrigerant recovered and is the phase where patience matters.

To accelerate vapor recovery, you can apply gentle heat to the system's evaporator or heat exchangers using a heat gun or warm water. This drives dissolved refrigerant out of the oil and out of cold system components. Do not use an open flame.

### Step 4: Monitor and Reach Required Vacuum

Continue vapor recovery until the system reaches the **required vacuum level**. Once the target vacuum is achieved, close the recovery machine valves and let the system sit for several minutes. Monitor the pressure gauge. If pressure rises significantly, refrigerant is still coming out of solution from oil or cold components. Resume recovery until the vacuum holds stable.

A system that will not hold vacuum after repeated recovery attempts likely has a leak. Note this in your documentation, as it affects the disposition of the equipment.

### Step 5: Disconnect and Secure

Once the required vacuum level is achieved and holding, disconnect your recovery equipment. Cap all service ports securely. Weigh the recovery cylinder and record the total amount of refrigerant recovered.

## Preventing Cross-Contamination

Cross-contamination is one of the most common and costly mistakes in refrigerant recovery. Mixing refrigerant types renders the entire cylinder contents unsuitable for reuse and creates an expensive disposal problem.

**Practical prevention measures include:**

- **Dedicate recovery cylinders by refrigerant type.** Label them clearly and prominently.
- **Flush your recovery machine and hoses** when switching between refrigerant types. Many recovery machines have a flush procedure in their manual.
- **Use a refrigerant identifier** when there is any doubt about the system's contents.
- **Never recover into a cylinder without verifying** what is already in it. Check both the label and the pressure. An empty R-22 cylinder should read approximately 0 psig if truly empty, not the saturation pressure of a different refrigerant.

## Documentation Requirements

EPA regulations require technicians to maintain records of refrigerant recovery. For each recovery event, document:

- **Date of recovery**
- **Type of refrigerant recovered**
- **Quantity recovered** (by weight)
- **System identification** (equipment type, location, owner)
- **Disposition of recovered refrigerant** (stored for reuse, sent for reclamation, sent for destruction)

Under **Subpart C**, which applies to HFC systems containing 15 or more pounds of refrigerant with a GWP above 53, the documentation requirements are more detailed and include chain-of-custody tracking for the recovered refrigerant.

FieldPad's **compliance log** captures all required recovery documentation as part of the service record. The cylinder management feature tracks individual recovery cylinders by serial number and weight, automatically calculating available capacity and flagging cylinders approaching the 80% fill limit. When you complete a recovery, the data is linked to the specific job, equipment, and client, creating a complete chain of documentation.

## Subpart C Considerations for HFC Recovery

For HFC refrigerants covered under the AIM Act's Subpart C, recovery requirements parallel Section 608 but apply to a broader range of systems. The key threshold is **15 pounds of charge** in systems using refrigerants with a GWP above 53. This captures most commercial and many residential systems using R-410A, R-134a, R-404A, and other common HFCs.

The recovery vacuum levels and procedures are the same as Section 608, but the recordkeeping requirements are more detailed. FieldPad automatically applies the correct regulatory framework based on the refrigerant type and system charge, ensuring your documentation meets the applicable requirements.

## Key Takeaways

- **Always identify the refrigerant before beginning recovery.** Assumptions lead to cross-contamination.
- **Use dedicated, properly labeled recovery cylinders** and never exceed 80% capacity by weight.
- **Recover liquid first, then vapor** for maximum efficiency. Be patient during the vapor phase.
- **Reach the required EPA vacuum level** and verify it holds before opening the system.
- **Prevent cross-contamination** by dedicating cylinders, flushing equipment, and verifying cylinder contents before each use.
- **Document every recovery** with date, refrigerant type, quantity, and disposition. FieldPad's compliance log and cylinder management features automate this recordkeeping.
- **Subpart C extends HFC recovery documentation requirements.** Know whether the system you are servicing falls under Section 608, Subpart C, or both.
