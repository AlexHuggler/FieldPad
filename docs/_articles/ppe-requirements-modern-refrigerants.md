Refrigerants are not benign substances. Every refrigerant used in HVAC systems, whether it is an older ODS compound like R-22, a common HFC like R-410A, or a newer A2L replacement like R-454B, poses specific health and safety risks during handling. **Frostbite from liquid contact**, **asphyxiation from vapor displacement of oxygen**, and **flammability with A2L compounds** are all real hazards that proper personal protective equipment is designed to mitigate.

Despite these risks, PPE compliance in the field is inconsistent. Solo technicians working on tight schedules often skip eye protection or reach for whatever gloves are in the truck. This guide provides a clear, practical framework for what you should be wearing and why, organized by refrigerant category and service scenario.

## Baseline PPE: Required for All Refrigerant Work

Regardless of the refrigerant type, every service event involving refrigerant handling requires the following **minimum PPE**:

### Safety Glasses or Chemical Splash Goggles

Liquid refrigerant released at atmospheric pressure undergoes rapid evaporation and cooling. A splash of liquid R-410A, R-22, or any other refrigerant to unprotected eyes can cause **cryogenic burns and permanent eye damage** in seconds. Safety glasses with side shields provide adequate protection for most service scenarios. When working with systems under high pressure or in positions where a liquid spray could contact your face directly (such as working below a fitting), upgrade to **chemical splash goggles** that seal against your face.

### Insulated Gloves Rated for Cold Contact

Standard leather or nitrile work gloves do not provide adequate protection against cryogenic contact. When liquid refrigerant contacts skin through an inadequate glove, the freezing effect happens before you can react. Use **insulated cryogenic-rated gloves** specifically designed for cold contact. These gloves typically feature a waterproof outer layer, an insulating mid-layer, and a comfortable inner lining. They should be long enough to cover your wrists and the lower portion of your forearms, where splashes commonly occur during hose connections and disconnections.

### Closed-Toe, Non-Slip Footwear

Closed-toe shoes or boots prevent liquid refrigerant from contacting your feet. Non-slip soles are equally important given that service environments frequently involve wet surfaces, rooftop access, and mechanical room floors that may be slippery. Steel-toe boots provide additional protection when working with heavy cylinders.

## Additional PPE by Refrigerant Category

### ODS Refrigerants (R-22, R-11, R-123)

ODS (Ozone-Depleting Substance) refrigerants are classified as **A1 (non-flammable)** under ASHRAE 34, so flammability PPE is not required. However, some ODS refrigerants have specific toxicity concerns:

- **R-123** (HCFC-123) has a relatively low **Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL)** of 50 ppm. When working with R-123, particularly in enclosed mechanical rooms with large centrifugal chillers, **continuous air monitoring** and **respiratory protection** may be necessary. An approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or a supplied-air respirator should be available if concentrations could exceed the OEL.
- **R-22** and **R-11** have higher OELs (1000 ppm for R-22), but in confined spaces or during large-volume recovery operations, concentrations can still reach dangerous levels. The primary risk is **oxygen displacement** rather than direct toxicity.

For standard ODS service work in well-ventilated spaces, the baseline PPE described above is sufficient.

### HFC Refrigerants (R-410A, R-134a, R-404A, R-407C)

HFC refrigerants are also classified as **A1 (non-flammable)** and have relatively high OELs. The PPE requirements are the same as the baseline:

- Safety glasses or goggles
- Insulated cryogenic-rated gloves
- Closed-toe footwear

The primary hazard during HFC handling is **cryogenic exposure** from liquid contact and **asphyxiation** in confined spaces. HFC vapors are heavier than air and will displace oxygen at floor level in poorly ventilated areas. If you feel lightheaded, have difficulty breathing, or notice a sweet chemical odor while working in an enclosed space, **leave the area immediately** and ventilate before re-entering.

### A2L Refrigerants (R-454B, R-32, R-452B)

A2L refrigerants introduce **flammability hazards** that require additional PPE considerations beyond the baseline:

- **Anti-static clothing**: Synthetic fabrics (polyester, nylon) can generate static electricity through friction. In a refrigerant-rich atmosphere, a static discharge can serve as an ignition source. Wear **natural fiber clothing** (cotton) or purpose-made **anti-static garments** when servicing A2L systems. Avoid removing or putting on clothing in the immediate work area, as this generates static.
- **Anti-static footwear**: Electrostatic discharge (ESD) rated shoes or boot straps help dissipate static charge that builds up while walking. This is especially important on carpeted or synthetic flooring.
- **No loose or dangling accessories**: Rings, watches, and metal jewelry can create sparks if they contact electrical terminals. Remove metallic accessories before working on A2L systems.

### Natural Refrigerants (R-290 Propane, R-744 CO2, R-717 Ammonia)

While less common in standard HVAC service, natural refrigerants have specific PPE requirements worth noting:

- **R-290 (propane)** is classified as **A3 (highly flammable)** and requires the most stringent flammability PPE, including flame-resistant clothing and full anti-static measures.
- **R-717 (ammonia)** is classified as **B2L (toxic and mildly flammable)**. Service on ammonia systems requires **full respiratory protection**, including SCBA for emergency response, along with chemical-resistant clothing and face protection.
- **R-744 (CO2)** operates at extremely high pressures (up to 1500+ psi on the high side in transcritical systems). Heavy-duty gloves, face shields, and awareness of the asphyxiation risk from CO2 displacement are essential.

## Confined Space PPE Upgrades

Many HVAC service scenarios involve **confined or semi-confined spaces**: equipment closets, mechanical rooms, crawl spaces, attics, and below-grade utility rooms. In these environments, the standard PPE baseline may be insufficient.

### When to Upgrade

Consider upgrading your PPE when:

- The work area has **limited ventilation** and cannot be adequately ventilated with portable fans
- The **total system charge** is large relative to the room volume
- You will be working **below grade** or in a space where refrigerant vapors can accumulate
- The service involves **opening the system** in an enclosed space (brazing, compressor replacement, filter drier replacement)

### What to Add

- **Portable oxygen monitor**: A personal O2 monitor worn at chest level alerts you if oxygen levels drop below safe thresholds (typically below 19.5%). This is inexpensive insurance against asphyxiation.
- **Refrigerant concentration monitor**: For A2L work in confined spaces, a monitor that alerts you when concentrations approach the lower flammability limit adds a critical layer of safety.
- **Respiratory protection**: A half-face respirator with appropriate cartridges (organic vapor/acid gas for most refrigerants) provides protection during brief exposures. For IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) concentrations, only SCBA or supplied-air respirators are adequate.

## PPE Inspection and Maintenance

PPE is only effective when it is in good condition. Build these checks into your routine:

- **Gloves**: Inspect for cracks, tears, or loss of insulating capacity before each use. Replace gloves that show signs of wear. Cryogenic gloves lose their insulating properties over time, even without visible damage.
- **Safety glasses/goggles**: Clean lenses regularly. Replace scratched lenses that impair visibility. Verify that goggles still seal properly against your face.
- **Clothing**: Inspect anti-static garments for damage. Wash according to manufacturer instructions to maintain anti-static properties.
- **Monitors**: Calibrate oxygen and refrigerant monitors according to the manufacturer's schedule. A monitor that reads incorrectly is worse than no monitor at all because it creates false confidence.

## Documenting PPE in Your Compliance Logs

EPA Section 608 and Subpart C regulations focus on refrigerant handling and recordkeeping rather than PPE specifically. However, **OSHA** general duty clause requirements and industry best practices call for documenting safety measures taken during service events. Recording that appropriate PPE was used during a service call strengthens your compliance record and demonstrates professional diligence.

FieldPad's compliance log includes the **A2L safety checklist** for flammable refrigerant service, which covers PPE verification as one of the six mandatory items. For all service events, you can add notes to your job records documenting the safety measures taken, creating a searchable history of your safety compliance.

## Key Takeaways

- **Minimum PPE for all refrigerant work** includes safety glasses or goggles, insulated cryogenic-rated gloves, and closed-toe footwear. No exceptions.
- **A2L refrigerants add flammability PPE requirements**: anti-static clothing, anti-static footwear, and removal of metallic accessories that could cause sparks.
- **Confined spaces require upgraded protection**, including portable oxygen monitors and potentially respiratory protection.
- **Inspect your PPE regularly.** Damaged gloves, scratched lenses, and uncalibrated monitors provide a false sense of security.
- **Document your PPE compliance** as part of your service records. FieldPad's A2L safety checklist captures PPE verification automatically for flammable refrigerant service events.
- **Never compromise on eye protection.** Cryogenic burns to unprotected eyes happen instantly and can cause permanent damage.
