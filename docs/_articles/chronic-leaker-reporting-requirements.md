summary: "Under EPA regulations, refrigeration or AC equipment is classified as a chronic leaker when cumulative refrigerant additions in a calendar year exceed 125% of the equipment's full charge. Once triggered, technicians must submit a chronic leaker report to the EPA by March 1 of the following year. The report must include equipment identification, refrigerant type and amounts added, leak rate history, and repair actions taken. Failure to report can result in significant EPA enforcement actions. FieldPad automatically monitors cumulative additions per equipment and alerts technicians when the 125% threshold is approached."

## What Is a Chronic Leaker?

Under EPA regulations, a piece of refrigeration or air conditioning equipment earns the **chronic leaker** designation when the total amount of refrigerant added to the system during a single calendar year exceeds **125% of the equipment's full charge**. Equipment requiring that volume of replacement refrigerant is losing it at a rate that poses environmental harm, regardless of whether individual repairs brought the system back within normal thresholds.

The chronic leaker rule applies to equipment containing **50 pounds or more of refrigerant** under Section 608 and equipment containing **15 pounds or more with a GWP above 53** under AIM Act Subpart C. Solo technicians who service commercial refrigeration, industrial process cooling, or large comfort cooling systems encounter chronic leaker situations regularly, particularly on aging rooftop units and walk-in cooler systems.

## How the 125% Calculation Works

The calculation is straightforward, but accuracy depends on two inputs: the **full charge of the system** and the **cumulative refrigerant additions** during the calendar year.

**Cumulative Additions / Full Charge x 100 = Annual Addition Rate**

If the result exceeds 125%, the equipment is a chronic leaker.

### A Practical Example

Consider a commercial refrigeration rack with a full charge of 200 pounds of R-404A:

| Service Date | Refrigerant Added |
|---|---|
| February 14 | 35 lbs |
| May 22 | 40 lbs |
| August 9 | 55 lbs |
| October 30 | 45 lbs |
| December 12 | 80 lbs |

**Total additions: 255 lbs** -- 255 / 200 x 100 = **127.5%** -- this system is a chronic leaker.

Every instance where refrigerant is charged into the system counts: post-repair recharges, top-offs, refrigerant added during component replacements, and refrigerant added after catastrophic losses. The only exception is refrigerant added during **initial commissioning** of new equipment.

## The March 1 Reporting Deadline

Once equipment crosses the 125% threshold, the owner or operator must submit a **chronic leaker report to the EPA by March 1 of the following year**. If a system exceeds 125% at any point during 2026, the report must be filed by **March 1, 2027**.

Many commercial clients rely on their service technician to handle this reporting, so the responsibility often falls directly on solo techs. You need to know which customers' systems crossed the threshold so you can file the report or notify the equipment owner of their filing obligation.

### Do Not Wait Until December

The moment cumulative additions cross 125%, the equipment is classified. The March 1 deadline is for **filing the report**, not for making the determination. Tracking additions throughout the year lets you have early conversations with equipment owners about replacement or overhaul options.

## What Must Be Included in the Report

### Required Elements

- **Equipment identification**: Location, type, serial number, manufacturer
- **Refrigerant type**: Specific designation (e.g., R-410A, R-404A)
- **Full charge amount** and total refrigerant added during the year
- **Dates and amounts of each addition**: Service-by-service breakdown
- **Leak rate history**: Calculated annualized leak rates per service event
- **Repair actions taken**: Description of each repair, including components replaced
- **Verification test results**: Initial and follow-up leak test records after each repair
- **Explanation of continued operation**: If the equipment was not retired or retrofitted, the owner must explain why

### Supporting Documentation

Maintain service invoices, refrigerant purchase receipts, recovery logs, and verification test documentation. The EPA can request these materials during an audit.

## Consequences of Failing to Report

The EPA treats chronic leaker reporting failures seriously:

- **Civil penalties up to $44,539 per day per violation** under the Clean Air Act
- **Mandatory equipment shutdown orders** for unreported chronic leakers
- **Increased audit frequency** for facilities tied to non-compliant technicians
- **Criminal referrals** in cases of willful non-reporting

For solo technicians, an enforcement action can be professionally devastating. Beyond financial penalties, your EPA certification can be suspended or revoked, ending your ability to legally handle refrigerants.

## Leak Rate vs. Chronic Leaker Status

These are **separate compliance concepts**. A system can exceed its leak rate threshold without becoming a chronic leaker, and vice versa. The key distinction: **leak rate threshold exceedance triggers repair obligations**, while **chronic leaker status triggers reporting obligations**. Both carry independent penalties for non-compliance.

## How FieldPad Tracks Chronic Leaker Status Automatically

FieldPad eliminates the manual tracking burden that makes chronic leaker compliance difficult for solo technicians:

- **Cumulative addition tracking**: Every refrigerant addition logged against an equipment profile is added to the running calendar-year total.
- **Threshold alerts**: Warning notifications fire at **100%** of full charge. At **125%**, a chronic leaker alert flags the equipment in your compliance dashboard.
- **Automatic report generation**: FieldPad compiles all required data -- service dates, amounts, leak rates, repair actions, verification tests -- into a formatted report ready for submission.
- **Deadline reminders**: Beginning in January, escalating reminders appear about the March 1 filing deadline for any equipment flagged in the previous year.
- **Equipment owner notifications**: Generate a summary for your customer explaining the classification and their obligations.

Because FieldPad maintains detailed compliance logs for every service event, the chronic leaker report is assembled from data already captured during normal service work. There is no separate data entry step or end-of-year scramble.

## Key Takeaways

- **125% is the threshold**: Equipment becomes a chronic leaker when calendar-year refrigerant additions exceed 125% of full charge.
- **March 1 is the deadline**: Reports must be filed with the EPA by March 1 of the year following the threshold exceedance.
- **Cumulative tracking is essential**: Every addition counts, so you must track every pound throughout the year.
- **Reports require detailed data**: Equipment ID, refrigerant type, every addition with dates, leak rate history, repair actions, and verification results.
- **Penalties are severe**: Daily fines exceeding $44,000 and potential certification revocation.
- **FieldPad automates the process**: Real-time tracking, threshold alerts, and automatic report generation from existing service data.
